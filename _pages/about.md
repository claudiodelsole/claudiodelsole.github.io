I am a fourth year PhD Student in [Statistics and Computer Science](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+statistics+and+computer+science) at Bocconi University. I'm working on Bayesian nonparametrics, under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio Lijoi](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/antoniolijoi/) and Prof. [Igor Pr√ºnster](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/igorpruenster/).
