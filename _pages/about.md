I am a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics at University of Milano-Bicocca. I'm working on Bayesian nonparametrics under the supervision of [Federico Camerlenghi](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/camerlenghi-federico/home-page).

I recently obtained a PhD in [Statistics and Computer Science](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+statistics+and+computer+science) at Bocconi University, under the supervision of [Antonio Lijoi](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/antoniolijoi/) and [Igor Prünster](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/igorpruenster/).

I'm also a member of the Bayesian Learning Laboratory ([Bayes Lab](https://bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/)) at Bocconi University.
