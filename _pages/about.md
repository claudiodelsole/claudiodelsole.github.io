I am a fourth year PhD Student in [Statistics and Computer Science](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/phd/phd+in+statistics+and+computer+science) at Bocconi University.

I'm working on Bayesian nonparametrics, under the supervision of Prof. [Antonio Lijoi](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/antoniolijoi/) and Prof. [Igor Prünster](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/igorpruenster/).

I'm also a member of the Bayesian Learning Laboratory ([Bayes Lab](https://bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/)) at Bocconi University.

## Upcoming talks and conferences

* **June 2024**: I will present my research at the [4th Italian Meeting on Probability and Mathematical Statistics](https://probabilityrome2024.it/) in Rome, Italy, within the contributed session *Recent Advances in Bayesian Nonparametric Statistics*, organized by Marta Catalano and Beatrice Franzolini.
* **July 2024**: I will present my research at the [ISBA World Meeting](https://www.unive.it/web/en/2208/home) in Venice, Italy, within the session *Discrete random structures in Bayesian nonparametrics*, organized by Antonio Lijoi and Igor Prünster.
